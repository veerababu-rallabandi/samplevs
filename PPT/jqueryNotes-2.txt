* jQuery(<code>)--It is a jQuery Function

*$(<code>)--It also alternative name of jQuery function

* $(document) -- jQuery function usually takes a single argument, in this example: document
* A jQuery object is like an array, which contains zero or more indexes. It also contains
object methods like: Length, Context, Selector

--> $(document).ready(): This is called DocumentReady, which is executed as soon as the document
is ready for DOM manipulation.

* jquery function chaining is one of the most powerful feature of jquery where it can perform multiple
methods on the same set of elements, it saves us and the browser from having to find the same elements more than once.

jquery selectors:class,id,etc..

Attribute selectore: With this you can select elements using element attribute.

ex: $("input[type]").
$("*")---universal

* Traversing the DOM
=====================
* In jquery, "Traversing" lets us to move through the DOM/HTML Elements in the web page.
* with "Query selectors" we make initial selection then move using Traversing functions.
* Having a strong commnad of the most common traversal functions will speed up your development time
find(),children, closest(), parent(),next(),prev(),siblings(),first(),last()---methods

DOM:
====
* one of the most important aspects of jquery , is DOM manipulation
* DOM manipulation using standard javascript can be pretty cumbersome, fortunatley
jquery comes with a bunch of DOm related methods
-->manipulat elements'content
   * text()--add/update text inside our html element
   * html()--insert/update html code of an element
   * val()--get/set form values
-->Add/remove Dom element
-->Modify an existing element
-->copy/clone an element
-->Add/remove/modify element's attribute


* after(),before() etcc..
Modifying properties & attributes:
=================================
* removeAttr(name)
*hasclass(class)
*addClass(class)
* removeClass(class)
*toggleClass(class)
* prop()
*.attr()

* copying elements:
===================
JQuery clone() is used to copy a matched elements.

Note : $.each() --iteraterates array, object, etc..
Note : .each()--iterating  

jquery filter:
==============
* eq() -- selects from the set of matched elements to the one at the spedified index

* Filter() -- Selects the set of matched elements to those that match the selectore or pass the function's 
test.

* has()--exist or not
* not()-it removes from the set of matched elements.


* .data() API reads HTML 5 data-* attributes from DOM. it converts the data values
to Javascript types.

jquery animate:
===============
syntax: .animate(properties[,duration][,easing][,complete])
properties--takes css properties and applies on element to make our animation
Duration : takes time in milliseconds to play our animation
Easing : Easing indicates transition effect which will be applied to animation.
Complete : here we can provide a callback function to execute soon after animation finishes.

Note : jquery is famous for its chaining concept, running multiple jquery commands, one after the other, on same elements.
This is called  "chaining"

form slectors:
* get: $('input:text').val();
* set: $('input[type=text]').val("new value");

Radio buttons:
$('input:radio') this selectors gets all the input fields with type texture

Get: $('input:radio[name=radiobutton-name]:checked').val();
Set : $('input:radio[name=radiobutton]')[0].checked=true;
or 
$('input:radio[name=radiobutton]:nth(0)').checked=true;

Hidden--$('input:hidden')
Get--$('input:hidden').val()
set--$('input:hidden').val("new")

* select(dropdown box): $(select) this selector gets all the selected values from selectbox

Get: $('#dropdown-id').val()
set: $('#dropdown-id').val('china')

Get selected index: $('select')[0].selectedIndex);
Set with index no: $('select')[0].selectedIndex=2;


Regular expression:
================
^--start of string
$--End of string
. --Any single character
+ -- one or more character
\-- Escape special characters
?---Zero or more characters

Regular expressions are commonly referred to as regex or regexp


* test()-- jquerytest() method tests for a match in a string, it returns true if it finds a match,
otherwise it returns false.
ex: reg.test(mailId)


Event Handling:
-==============
* jquery makes it easy to respond to user interaction on web page.
events --click, keypress, mouse movement, resize


Events:
========
* Binding event handlers: In jquery we can establish event handlers on DOM Elements with the bind() method.

unbind()--This will remove any event handlers that you have attached with the bind() function.

* we used the bind() & unbind() methods to attach and detach event handlers to various elements on the page but this methods
fail to attach even handlers when elements are added dynamically.

* using the live() method, you can attach your event handler to any future elements which matches your original selector.

*  .on()---both directly binding events & creating delegated events.


Note : .on() method --attaching many events to one event handler.

ex: $().on("mouseenter mouseleave",function(){})


* Event object--> whenever an event is triggered, the event handler function recieves one argument i.e. an event object that is
normalized acrooss browser.


Note:
1. Preventing the defaiult action: For many element there is some default action like, when you click on <a> its
default action is to navigate to a link.
2. .preventDefault() -- This method is used to prevent the default behaviour or an event, it is called on event
object.

.stopPropagation()---it is called event bubbling , to avoid triggering events all the way up to the DOM.

* one()---somethimes you need a particular event handler to run/execute only once.
* off()-method to remove/clean event handlers.


*  Triggering Event Handlers:
-> .trigger()--jquery provides a way to trigger the event handlers bound to an element without a any user interaction.
-> When an event handler is added using .on('click',function(){}),it can be triggered using jquery's .trigger("click")
bcoz jquery stores a reference to that handler when it is originally added.
additionally, it will trigger the javascript inside the onclick attribute.
--> the .trigger() function cannont be used to mimic native browser 
events, such as clicking an anchor tag.


Ajax:

=====
* Data can be transferred b/w browser & server, with the XMLHttpRequest API, without having to reload the
web page using Ajax.
* These Ajax requests are written & executed with js code:
  ->The code sends a request to a URL and when it receives a response, a callback function is executed to handle the response.
* request being asynchronous , the rest of your code continues to execute while the request is being processed and response is
received in xml format, this technology is called AJAX(asynchronous javascript and xml)

* unfortunately, different browsers implement the Ajax API differently.
* Developers need to instatiate XHR object differently to support different browsers and would have to struggle
to ensure that ajax would work properly with all browsers.
* jquery provides $.ajax() method that abstracts away painful browser differences. This method offers full-featured AJAX functionalities
methods:
$.get()
$.getScript()
$.getJSON()
$.post()
$().load()


* Two most common methods for sending request to a server are GET and POST
1. GET - The GET method should be used for operations where you are only "getting" data from the server, not changing data on the server.
Eg: a serach query can be a GET request.
Get requests generally sends their data by appending into URL using query string.

2. POST -- The POST method should be used for operations where you are changing data on the server
Eg: a user saving a blog post can be a POST request

* Post request are generally not cached by the browser; a query string can be part of url, but the data tends to be sent separately as post
data.


DataTypes: jquery $.ajax() requires some instruction as to the type of data you get back from an  AJAX request, 
* text - transfers simple string
* html - transfers block of HTML
* script - to add a new script to pages
* json - transfer json formatted data, which include striing, objects and arrays
* jsonp - used for JSON data from another domain
* xml - transfers data in custom XML schema


* Same-Origin policy and JSONP : To make a Ajax requests it should be from are the same protocol (http or https), the same port and same domain which is called as
Same-Origin policy.
* This was drawback from AJAX and this limitation was not applicable to scripts that are loaded via jQuery's AJAX methods

* To make AJax reqiuest from different domain we can use JSONP
* In the case of JSONP, the provider of the service will respond to the AJAX request with a script that can be loaded into the page using a <script> tag,
thus avoiding the same-origin limitation; that script will include the data you requested, wrapped in a callback function you provdie

Ajax method:
=============
* jquery offers many Ajax-related simple & convenience methods but the primary method is $.ajax()
* $.ajax() method is powerful & straightforward way of creating Ajax requests
* it takes configuration object that contains all the instructions jquery requeis to complete request 
* $.ajax() options - there are many options available for $.ajax() method, which it more powerful


* async - Accepts true/false, default is true. False will make request synchronously and will block execution of other code until response is received.
* cache - use to cache your response if available, default is true for all datatiypes except "script" and "jsonp"
* complete - Triggers a callback function to run when the request is complete, regardless of success or failure
* data- The data to be sent to server, it can be either string or object.
* dataType - This specifies the type of data you expect from server
* error - callback function to run when request gets an error
* jsonp - This specifies the callback name to send in a queriy string when making a JSONP request.
the default is "Callback"

* success -
* timeout -
* type - This specifies the type of request, "post" or "Get" .default is "GET"
* url - This is request URL
        -> The "url" options is the only mandatory property in the configuration onbject, all ohter
           properties are optional.
