A common  piece of view code(HTML code) which is available for all the Views in website
in known partial view.

* partial view can have HTML code 
* partial view can have C# code also.
* These are available to entire website to we put them in shared folder.

How to use:

* There are two methods in to render partial view-

1. @Html.Partial("viewName")
2. @Html.RenderPartial("viewName")


Difference b/w Html.Partial & @Html.RenderPartial

partial
=======
* @Html.Partial("_PartialView")
* Returns MvcHtmlString
* Can assign output to a variable

RenderPartial
=============
@{Html.RenderPartial("_PartialView");}
* Returns Void
* Result is written directly to output stream.

which one is fast:  @Html.RenderPartial (bcoz it returns void & its ouptut is 
directly written to output stream.)
